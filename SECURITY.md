## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the PCAP Analysis project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: security@[your-domain].com

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### PCAP File Handling

When analyzing PCAP files, be aware that:

1. **Malicious PCAPs**: PCAP files from untrusted sources may contain:
   - Exploit attempts targeting packet parsing libraries
   - Malformed packets designed to crash analyzers
   - Excessive data designed to exhaust resources

2. **Sensitive Data**: PCAP files often contain:
   - Credentials and authentication tokens
   - Personal information
   - Proprietary protocols and data

### Best Practices

1. **Isolate Analysis**: Run analysis in isolated environments when dealing with untrusted PCAPs
2. **Resource Limits**: Set memory and CPU limits for analysis processes
3. **Input Validation**: Validate PCAP file structure before processing
4. **Data Sanitization**: Remove sensitive data before sharing analysis results

### Safe Usage Guidelines

```bash
# Run with resource limits
ulimit -m 2097152  # 2GB memory limit
ulimit -t 300      # 5 minute CPU time limit
python scripts/pcap_analyzer.py untrusted.pcap

# Use Docker for isolation (example)
docker run --rm -m 2g --cpus="1.0" \
  -v $(pwd):/data \
  pcap-analyzer untrusted.pcap
```

## üîç Security Features

The project includes several security features:

1. **Input Validation**: All scripts validate input parameters
2. **Safe Parsing**: Uses well-tested libraries (Scapy) for packet parsing
3. **No Execution**: Scripts never execute extracted code or commands
4. **Read-Only**: Analysis is read-only, no network connections made
5. **Credential Masking**: Passwords are redacted in reports

## üìã Security Checklist for Contributors

When contributing code, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Safe file handling (path traversal prevention)
- [ ] No use of `eval()` or `exec()` with user input
- [ ] Proper error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Resource consumption limits where applicable
- [ ] Security-focused unit tests

## üö® Known Security Limitations

1. **Memory Usage**: Large PCAP files can consume significant memory
2. **CPU Usage**: Complex analysis can be CPU intensive
3. **Disk Space**: Reports and extracted data can consume disk space
4. **Parser Vulnerabilities**: Dependent on upstream library security

## üîÑ Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch release
- **High**: Within 7 days
- **Medium**: Within 30 days
- **Low**: Next regular release

## üìù Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported releases
4. Release patches and publish security advisory

## üôè Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's efforts in helping keep this project secure. Contributors who report valid security issues will be acknowledged (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).
